### 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this project, the author was tasked with helping a fictional company begin a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s using archival .csv files from that period. It proceeded in three stages: **Data Modeling**, **Data Engineering**, and **Data Analysis**.

- [**Data Modeling**](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL_diagram_scan.png)

Prior to expending the effort to create and populate tables, lists and the interrelationships of their attributes were sketched using an [Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) (see **Figure 1**, below). The author considered using [pgAdmin 4's](https://www.pgadmin.org/) built-in *ERD For Database* tool, but ultimately employed the free [*QuickDBD*](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) functionality, whose output looks less convoluted than *ERD For Database*. However, even with this choice, not every permuation of entity placement could be adequately displayed, so some [foreign key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key) connection lines overlap, which is not optimal.

The *emp_no* (Employee Number) variable served to link several, though not all, lists as a foreign key. The *dept_emp* (presumably: Department *of* Employee) list didn't have a unique attribute, so both *emp_no* and *dept_no* (Department Number) were used as a [composite key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key) (as noted by the red arrow in **Figure 1**).

![EmployeeSQL_scan](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/assets/127694342/1991eadc-50ba-49c1-a5bc-58482a6166fa)

**Figure 1** | *Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for lists and their attributes*

- [**Data Engineering**](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL_code_schemata.sql)

A dedicated *EmployeeSQL_db* database was created for this project, associated with postgreSQL server 15 in pgAdmin 4 version 7.

The name conversions from the ERD are as follows, in alphabetical order by diagram entity name and with the construction ERD ENTITY = *LIST*.

1. Departments ERD item = *departments* list
2. Department_of_Employee ERD item = *dept_emp* list
3. Employees ERD item = *employees* list
4. Managers ERD item = *dept_manager* list
5. Salaries ERD item = *salaries* list
6. Titles ERD item = *titles* list
   
*departments list:*

The *dept_name* attribute was made unique, since this is the "source of truth" for department names on all other lists. **See Figure 2 and Code Block 1, both below.**

![departments_table](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/assets/127694342/d8dcbf85-f100-40f7-aad9-7cd3c24b0d61)

**Figure 2** | *departments list table and postgreSQL code*

```
-- Create departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_no VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    dept_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (dept_no),
    UNIQUE (dept_name) -- source of truth for rest of tables
);

SELECT * FROM departments;
```
**Code Block 1** | *departments list table postgreSQL code block*

*dept_emp list:*

As aforementioned, this list didn't have a unique attribute, so both *emp_no* and *dept_no* (Department Number) were used as a [composite key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), as commented in the code. **See Figure 3 and Code Block 2, both below.**

![dept_emp_table](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/assets/127694342/5a43c9c9-3db2-486a-94f0-81b219ec7f11)

**Figure 3** | *dept_emp list table and postgreSQL code*

```
-- Create dept_emp table
CREATE TABLE dept_emp (
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    dept_no VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES employees (emp_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_no) REFERENCES departments (dept_no),
    PRIMARY KEY (emp_no, dept_no) -- composite key
);

SELECT * FROM dept_emp;
```

*dept_manager list:*

 **See Figure 4 and Code Block 3, both below.**

![dept_manager_table](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/assets/127694342/94255ac3-ee4f-45c0-9f8e-342fb1deab47)

**Figure 4** | *dept_manager list table and postgreSQL code*

```
-- Create dept_manager table
CREATE TABLE dept_manager (
    dept_no VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_no) REFERENCES departments (dept_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES employees (emp_no),
    PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
);

```

*employees list:*

 **See Figure 5 and Code Block 4, both below.**

**Figure 5** | *employees list table and postgreSQL code*

```
-- Create employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    emp_title_id VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
);

```

*salaries list:*

 **See Figure 6 and Code Block 5, both below.**

![salaries_table](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/assets/127694342/fb9f7058-c93e-4a05-9200-dc2b7801e0b5)

**Figure 6** | *salaries list table and postgreSQL code*

```
-- Create salaries table
CREATE TABLE salaries (
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    salary INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES employees (emp_no),
    PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
);

SELECT * FROM salaries;
```
**Code Block 5** | *salaries list table postgreSQL code block*

*titles list:*

The *title* attribute was made unique, since this is the "source of truth" for titles on all other lists. **See Figure 7 and Code Block 6, both below.**

![titles_table](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/assets/127694342/c3bcb885-b4b4-4b3b-b81d-1bcaaa83918c)

**Figure 7** | *titles list table and postgreSQL code*

```
-- Create titles table
CREATE TABLE titles (
    title_id VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (title_id),
    UNIQUE (title) -- source of truth for rest of tables
);

SELECT * FROM titles;
```
**Code Block 6** | *titles list table postgreSQL code block*

*Scan of code to display tables:*

The order of tables, above, is alphabetical, but the tables were coded and run in a sequence to allow foreign keys to refer back to where they originate in previous blocks of code. See **Figure 8** for the actual run sequence.

![display_tables](https://github.com/aglantzrbc/sql-challenge/assets/127694342/38b52fad-29c8-42e9-9b7e-260153578403)
